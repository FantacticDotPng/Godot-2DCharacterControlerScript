# Godot 2D Character Controller Script
This is a script I made for a 2D platformer character in Godot (along with two other scripts).

#The 2D platformer script includes:
Variable jumping (Hold down jump longer to jump higher)

Coyote jumping (You're still able to jump for a split second after walking off a platform)

Buffer jumping (If you press the jump button before hitting the ground if you land soon after then you still jump)

Corner/Ledge nudging (If you just barely miss a jump then the controller will nudge you up slightly, and if you bonk your head the controller will push you in the 
direction you meant to go instead of just stopping you)

Movement speed-based running animation (If you move faster then the running animation plays faster)

Slope support (The player can move up and down slopes, though you will run off of slopes if you're moving too fast)
